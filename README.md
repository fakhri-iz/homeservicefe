# Full-Stack Laravel 11 React TypeScript: Web Book Home Service
Built using Laravel 11 as the back-end and React Typescript as the front-end.

## Develop:
- Design and implement Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to build a well-structured database and create relationships between tables in the project database.
- Build a Content Management System (CMS) using Laravel 11 and Filament PHP, enabling efficient and fast data management.
- Create a robust RESTful API with Laravel, and test the API using Postman to ensure the application is ready to be used in real scenarios.
- Create reusable components in React JS, which allows code to be more modular and manageable.
- Use React JS hooks such as useState and useEffect to manage state and side effects in applications more efficiently.
- Consume APIs from Laravel into React JS applications dynamically, ensuring seamless integration between backend and frontend.
